# Project Name
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same. 


## Table of Contents
Data loading 
Data processing like scalaing and encoding 
Data analysis to find p values and VIF 
Drop columnns that dont influence prediction 
test train split 
Train the model on training set 
Predict on the test set 

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
Upgrad assignment on linear regression 


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
the temperature and  the weather situation seems to influecne the model or the number of users using the bike to a greater extent . Since the dataset has data only for two years , the year also has an influence on the model . The other parameters like if its holiday or weekday has not much relevance. The variables like holiday and month were dropped as these had high correlation with existing other independent variables
